                Biometrics Authentication is a technical term that refers to
                human's physical or behavioral traits authentication. With
                Biometric authentication, a data-generated model is produced
                that represents an individual user. Each time a user wants to
                authenticate, the generated model will be compared against one
                of the physiological traits of a user. The most well known
                physiological traits are:

                      Physiological Identifiers
                    </th>
                    <th style={{ color: "yellow" }}></th>
                  </tr>

                    <td>Fingerprints</td>

                  Biometric Authentication systems are less exposed to
                  vulnerabilities as users' biometric data are unique.
                  fraudulently replicating an individualâ€™s fingerprint or facial
                  recognition becomes very difficult as robust solutions exist
                  with strong liveness/spoof detection. Because of the very
                  convenient usability and the strong secure mechanism,
                  biometrics are considered the most convenient authentication
                  methodology.{" "}
